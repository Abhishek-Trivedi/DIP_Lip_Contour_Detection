# DIP_Lip_Contour_Detection
A project to implement efficient lip contour detection.

### Project id:  38

### Project Tiltle: MULTI-THRESHOLD LIP CONTOUR DETECTION

### Github Link: https://github.com/Abhishek-Trivedi/DIP_Lip_Contour_Detection
                
### Team Members: Abhishek Trivedi     Prajwal Shingala

### Main goal of the project : An effiecient implementation of robust algorithm for extraction of lip contour from high-resolution static images through Divide and Conquer approach followed by Multi-Threshold method. 

### Problem Definition: Automatic Lip Contour has became an essential issue in face image analysis. Many problems like human-machine interaction, emotional analysis, person Identification etc require an fully automated lip contour detection technique. Moreover the presence or absence of teeth, beard or the low contrast between lip and skin requires an efficient and robust approach to solve the problem.

### Proposed Solution:
