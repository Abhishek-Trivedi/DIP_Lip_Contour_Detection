# DIP_Lip_Contour_Detection
A project to implement efficient lip contour detection.

### Project id:  38

### Project Tiltle: MULTI-THRESHOLD LIP CONTOUR DETECTION

### Github Link: https://github.com/Abhishek-Trivedi/DIP_Lip_Contour_Detection
                
### Team Members: Abhishek Trivedi     Prajwal Shingala

### Main goal of the project : An effiecient implementation of robust algorithm for extraction of lip contour from high-resolution static images through Divide and Conquer approach followed by Multi-Threshold method. 

### Problem Definition: Automatic Lip Contour has became an essential issue in face image analysis. Many problems like human-machine interaction, emotional analysis, person Identification etc require a fully automated lip contour detection technique. Moreover the presence or absence of teeth, beard or the low contrast between lip and skin requires an efficient and robust approach to solve the problem.

### Proposed Solution: We first will detect the two ends of lips. After that we will divide the lips in upper and lower lip and solve for each lip separately (contour extraction) . For robustness we will transform RGB to YIQ and then use segmentation and multi-thresholding. We will use different threshold for upper and lower lip.

### Results: Accurate lip contour extraction revealing shape detials of the lip boundaries.

### Milestones:
1) Converting RGB to YIQ : 3 Oct
2) Dividing lips into upper and lower part : 10 Oct
3) Segmentation and Thresholding : 15 OCt
4) Active Contouring : 19 Oct
5) Boundary Detection of lips : 23 Oct
6) Final testing on data : 27 Oct

### Tasks by each :
Odd numbers will be done by Prajwal and Even number tasks will be done by Abhishek.
